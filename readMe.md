#                        GuideToPython3

              I know it's self explanatory if you're
              already in this directory, but for those
              who don't know, this directory and all
              it's sub-directories, are a collection
              of files meant to help facilitate an
              understanding of the python programming
              language.

              I started the process of creating this
              guide, mainly to go over the basics of
              my python skills.  As I worked with the
              resources available to me, and as I
              delved further and further into the
              language, I realized that there is a
              massive amount of information that you
              learn, but eventually forget.

              I found myself re-discovering python
              again and honestly it was a joy.

              To anyone who reads this, my biggest
              advice for learning anything, is to
              teach it as best as you can to someone
              else or even to yourself.

              It's often said that if you can't teach
              a subject, you don't understand that
              subject well enough.

              That main concept was the origin of this
              guide.  Which on that topic, I kind of
              don't like calling this a guide because
              for me, at least, it's more of a
              reference resource.  As mentioned before
              you learn a lot of things, only to
              eventually forget them.

              That is how I intend these files to be
              used, as a reminder of all the things
              you can do with python.

              Lastly, and as kindheartedly as possible, this guide is
              a petition to all programmers to
              improve it where you see fit.  I'm not
              a professional (yet) and I don't do this for
              my job (yet), I just noticed these guides
              helped me with my python skills.  I hope
              you all enjoy them and use these newfound
              skills to enhance your lives, and the lives
              of others.
