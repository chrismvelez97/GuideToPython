#                           How to use the max() function

'''
The max() function grabs the largest number in a set of numbers

Note that for min, max, and sum, you can only do them on lists full of numbers.
also it is not a method attached to the number datatype which is why it is in
the techniques folder instead of the num_methods folder.
'''
numbers = list(range(11))
print (numbers)
#   results: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

print(max(numbers))
#   results: 10
