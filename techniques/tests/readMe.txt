                                  Tests

                      Tests, help you to test your code
                      to make sure that it is working
                      exactly how you'd like it to.

                      Python has a unittest module
                      which we'll be using to learn
                      more about testing, and what
                      a passing, and failing, test look
                      like, as well with how to use
                      them to our advantage.

                      With that said, we will be using
                      multiple sub-directories like we
                      did with the files folder.  This
                      means that code that is related
                      to each other will be placed in
                      the same directories but this
                      directory in general will be
                      filled with sub-directories
                      based on whatever topic is
                      relevant.
