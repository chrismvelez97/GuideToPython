                                        Files

                    It should be noted that before getting to this
                    point in the guide you should have an extremely
                    firm understanding in the basics of python.

                    Without this basic understanding, most of this
                    folder will be extremely difficult to learn.
                    This readMe.txt file serves only as a gentle
                    warning.

                    Given that you do understand, the directory
                    structure of this folder will be slightly
                    different.

                    Because we're working with python reading
                    files and writing into them and from them,
                    many of our files will be interlinked.

                    To make an easier sense of this, we will be
                    putting the files that belong together in
                    sub-directories to notify their relation.

                    Lastly, just so you don't have any
                    unnecessary trouble, you should know that
                    if your text editor for programming has a
                    package that runs your code and shows your
                    output rather than executing from the
                    terminal, that it won't work.

                    So basically you must execute from the
                    terminal.
