'''
If you've been programming for a bit
you'll start to notice a little something
called errors.

Yes, they are frustrating especially
because the rest of your program
might be running just fine, but a single
error crashes a program.

This is where exceptions come in handy.

Exceptions, make exceptions for errors
in your program so that that block of
code may fail silently, basically meaning
the rest of your code will run even if
there are errors.

In order to use errors, however you must
know which error you are expecting.

This is an easy enough problem to solve
since you're bound to become familiar
with certain errors.

Errors are handled by try-except
blocks.

Now I usually the part where you can
expect some code to show how it works,
but instead I want to progressively
create a catalogue of errors and how
to use exceptions in each and every
file named off of the error.

See the rest of this directory for
examples.
