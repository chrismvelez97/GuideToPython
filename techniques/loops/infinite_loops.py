#                               Infinite loops

'''
I will have an example for an infinite loop HOWEVER it should be noted that
infinite loops must be avoided at all times.

Every single loop needs a way to end.  If you happen to get stuck in an
infinite loop press control c, or close the window and restart the program
AFTER fixing the code.

while 1 == 1:
    print (1)
