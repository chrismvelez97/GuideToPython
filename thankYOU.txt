                          Thank You

            I want to say a sort of preemptive thank
            you to everyone who reads through these files
            and pulls them off of github, but I also want
            to make sure I give credit to where credit is
            due.  This guide and just most of my own
            personal knowledge of python comes from the
            book 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes.

            Some examples and explanations are from this
            book, as I wouldn't have been able to explain
            certain topics myself, and I wouldn't have
            been able to get as far in my own personal
            understanding without this book.


            So to Mr. Matthes, thank you for everything I
            know and for the seed of passion for everything
            I will eventually know.

            Here's the link to buy his actual book if
            you're interested, WHICH YOU SHOULD BE.
